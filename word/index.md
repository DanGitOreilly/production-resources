# O'Reilly Media Word Template Quickstart Guide

Congratulations on joining the ranks of O'Reilly authors! We know you're anxious to get started writing, so this document has the bare essentials you'll need to begin working right away.

## System Requirements

This template was created using Word 2000 for Windows. Yeah, it’s kind of old. But it still works! There are many different versions of Word out there, so you might encounter some differences in your specific setup compared to what we talk about here. 

IMPORTANT: Our template is not fully compatible with Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac. The styling buttons work pretty well, but most of the macros aren’t supported in this particular version of Word for Mac.

## Installing the Template

The template contains numerous customizations and macros (short programs written in Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA). In order for these customizations to work properly, and to be available whenever you're working on your manuscript, you'll need to store this template in a special templates folder on your computer.

IMPORTANT: Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of versions of Word out there. You might have to adapt the following, depending on where your templates folder is.

### Windows

On most Windows systems, the Word templates folder is:

*C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates*

If you can't find this folder, another way to determine where Word stores your templates is to open up a new Word document, then choose File→Save As, then select "Document Template" from the pulldown menu at the bottom of the dialog box. This will automatically place you in the templates folder. Just make a note of where on your computer that folder is located. 

Once you've found the templates folder on your computer, move the template file to that folder. To be sure your installation was successful, go to File→New, and make sure that "ORA.dot" is listed as one of the choices.
