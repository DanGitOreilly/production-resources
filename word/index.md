# O'Reilly Media Word Template Quickstart Guide

Congratulations on joining the ranks of O'Reilly authors! We know you're anxious to get started writing, so this document has the bare essentials you'll need to begin working right away.

## System Requirements

This template was created using Word 2000 for Windows. Yeah, it’s kind of old. But it still works! There are many different versions of Word out there, so you might encounter some differences in your specific setup compared to what we talk about here. 

NOTE: Our template is not fully compatible with Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac. The styling buttons work pretty well, but most of the macros aren’t supported in this particular version of Word for Mac.

## Installing the Template

The template contains numerous customizations and macros (short programs written in Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA). In order for these customizations to work properly, and to be available whenever you're working on your manuscript, you'll need to store this template in a special templates folder on your computer.

NOTE: Like we mentioned before, there are a lot of versions of Word out there. You might have to adapt the following, depending on where your templates folder is.

### Installing on a Windows Machine

On most Windows systems, the Word templates folder is:

*C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates*

If you can't find this folder, another way to determine where Word stores your templates is to open up a new Word document, then choose File→Save As, then select "Document Template" from the pulldown menu at the bottom of the dialog box. This will automatically place you in the templates folder. Just make a note of where on your computer that folder is located. 

Once you've found the templates folder on your computer, move the template file to that folder. To be sure your installation was successful, go to File→New, and make sure that "ORA.dot" is listed as one of the choices.

### Installing on a Mac

Save the template to your desktop, then double-click to open it. When you open it, the title bar should read "ORA.dot", and not Document 1. If it doesn't say "ORA.dot", skip to the next section.

If the opened file says "ORA.dot", choose File→Save, and choose Save As Template. Save the template in your My Templates folder. Close the template, then exit and restart Word. The template will now be available from the Project Gallery. You can send the copy on your desktop to the Trash.

#### If the template opens as a document

If the template opens as a document, and not as a template (if it says "Document1" in the title bar, and not "ORA.dot"), close the document without saving changes. Move the ORA.dot file from your desktop to your My Templates folder. The template will now be available from the Project Gallery.

## The O'Reilly Menus and Toolbars

In addition to the two custom toolbars you should see on your screen (labeled "O'Reilly SmartStyler" and "O'Reilly Toolbar"—if you don't see them, go to View→Toolbars, and be sure they're checked), you'll notice two new menus, labeled "ORAStyles" and "ORATools." Among these toolbars and menus, you should be able to find most of the tools you'll need.

## Setting a Few Important Options

There are a few Word options that you should set to help yourself work better with the template. These aren't essential, but unless you have a compelling reason to want them off, you should probably turn and leave them on.

1.	Tools→Options→View→Field Shading→Always (note this is different from the check box marked "Field Codes")
2.	Tools→Options→View→Paragraph Marks
3.	Tools→Options→View→Bookmarks

## Paragraph and Character Styles

Now that you've arranged your workspace, you're ready to start writing. But first, you need to know that all of your text must have a *Style* applied to it. Every single paragraph needs to have a *Paragraph Style* applied, and if you want certain characters within a paragraph to look different than the rest of that paragraph, such as applying *Italics*, **Bold**, or `Literal`, you'll be using a *Character Style*. 

Styles are just named sets of formatting attributes, used to identify and group structurally identical elements in a document.
Once you've gotten familiar with the keyboard shortcuts and the SmartStyler, you'll find you won't need to spend much time searching for which style to use. But for now, know that you can find all the Paragraph and Character (also known as *Inline*) styles either from the menu labeled "ORAStyles," or on the O'Reilly Toolbar. They are grouped by category. There are a lot of them, for sure, but that's because we need a lot of them. Again, once you've adjusted to the SmartStyler and hopefully picked up a few keyboard shortcuts, you'll find you won't need to spend much time in these menus searching for styles.

There are two buttons on the SmartStyler that you may not recognize. The button marked "C" stands for `Code`, or `Literal`. This is for text that represents computer code or output. The "P" button stands for "Plain", and removes any character, or inline, formatting from the selected text. We encourage you to experiment with the SmartStyler to become familiar with its results.
