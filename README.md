# Production Resources

The gh-pages branch of this repo is home for the files used to generate http://oreillymedia.github.io/production-resources/.

The web page content is generated from markdown source (well, actually it's kramdown) using Jekyll. For details, see GitHub notes about GitHub Pages and then check out Jekyll documentation. After that, reverse engineer and Google.
