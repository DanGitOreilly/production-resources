# O'Reilly Media Illustration Guidelines

Congratulations on signing your book with O'Reilly Media. This document will help you understand the procedure for using screenshots and technical illustrations in your book.

You can contact O'Reilly's Illustrator at dcps-illustrations@oreilly.com.

## Types of Figures

There are two main types of figures: screenshots and drawn figures.

### Screenshots

Most readers want a literal depiction of what they see as they use new software; a screenshot provides just that. Our goal is to produce quality printed versions of what users will see on screen. Here are a few tips to make this possible (and to save you time):

*	Do not save screenshots as JPEGs. Please use TIF, PNG, or BMP.
*	Please crop your images to the smallest necessary area when a full desktop screenshot is not required. The less in the screenshot, the easier it will be for your audience to read it.
*	Do not add callouts or modify your files. We will do all of that for you; just let us know if you require callouts and supply one file with callouts added and one without. (Callouts are text, circles, lines, and arrows added to screenshots or photos that label or describe elements.)


### Drawn Figures

Drawn figures can help clarify concepts that are difficult to convey to your readers through text alone. When initially rendering your figures, you should use whatever method is most comfortable for you. Figures can be sketched, described in text, or generated using a computer drawing program. If you are using a program such as Visio, PowerPoint, Freehand, Illustrator, or another drawing program, please export your files as PDFs to ensure that there are no translation errors between computers.

To help you generate the images, we have templates in Adobe Illustrator and as PDFs that should be able to be opened in your vector program of choice. Just let us know you want to try your hand at them! If you do choose to work with the Illustrator templates, please send us the .ai files you create, along with exported pdfs. These files have been included in this Illustration Orientation Packet.

All illustrations will be modified to fit the style of O'Reilly books; you should not be concerned with creating a masterpiece. Whatever the quality of the original diagram, we will work with you to create a refined graphic.

While many figures are straightforward, some are complex and require a collaborative effort. In these instances, you'll need to explain the intent of the figure or supply supporting text to us. We can then determine the most effective manner to graphically represent the information.
