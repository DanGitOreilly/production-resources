# O'Reilly Media Illustration Guidelines

Congratulations on signing your book with O'Reilly Media. This document will help you understand the procedure for using screenshots and technical illustrations in your book.

You can contact O'Reilly's Illustrator at dcps-illustrations@oreilly.com.

## Types of Figures

There are two main types of figures: screenshots and drawn figures.

### Screenshots

Most readers want a literal depiction of what they see as they use new software; a screenshot provides just that. Our goal is to produce quality printed versions of what users will see on screen. Here are a few tips to make this possible (and to save you time):

*	Do not save screenshots as JPEGs. Please use TIF, PNG, or BMP.
*	Please crop your images to the smallest necessary area when a full desktop screenshot is not required. The less in the screenshot, the easier it will be for your audience to read it.
*	Do not add callouts or modify your files. We will do all of that for you; just let us know if you require callouts and supply one file with callouts added and one without. (Callouts are text, circles, lines, and arrows added to screenshots or photos that label or describe elements.)


### Drawn Figures

Most illustrations will be modified to fit the style of O'Reilly books; don't be concerned with creating a masterpiece. Whatever the quality of the original diagram, we will work with you to create a refined graphic.

Drawn figures can help clarify concepts that are difficult to convey to your readers through text alone. When initially rendering your figures, you should use whatever method is most comfortable for you. Figures can be sketched, described in text, or generated using a computer drawing program. If you are using a program such as Visio, PowerPoint, Freehand, Illustrator, or another drawing program, please export your files as PDFs to ensure that there are no translation errors between computers.

To help you generate the images, [we have templates in Adobe Illustrator](image-stuff.zip) and as PDFs that should be able to be opened in your vector program of choice. Just let us know you want to try your hand at them! If you do choose to work with the Illustrator templates, please send us the .ai files you create, along with exported pdfs. 

While many figures are straightforward, some are complex and require a collaborative effort. In these instances, you'll need to explain the intent of the figure or supply supporting text to us. We can then determine the most effective manner to graphically represent the information.

## Figure Sizing

When creating your figures, please be aware of page size limitations. See the following chart for various figure sizing according to trim size and series. 

Series   |   Trim Size   |   Max Figure Size  
--- | --- | ---
Animal Books | 7 x 9.1875 inches | 4.8 x 7 inches
Lean Series | 6 x 9 inches | 4.2 x 7 inches
Maker Press | 1 of 2 columns | 2.5 x 7 inches
Maker Press | 2 of 2 columns | 6.5 x 7 inches
Maker Press | Single column | 4.8 x 7 inches

## Orgainizing with a Figure List

The way you organize and track your figures is a critical part of the production process, and effort here will help ensure a speedy production cycle.

### Numbering Figures 

As you write and compile art, you may not be keeping your files organized in a way that anyone else can easily understand; however, keep in mind that eventually these files will need to be numbered according to where they will appear in the book.

When your book is submitted, the text and art files are sent to different departments. If the submitted figure files are not numbered, there is no way for us to know the chapter and order they go in. The best way to rectify this is to rename all of your image files before submitting them, following the scheme 0101.ext (for chapter 1, figure 1.file extension), 0102.ext (chapter 1, figure 2), 0201.ext (chapter 2, figure 1), 1001.ext (chapter 10, figure 1), etc. Not only will this help us process your book faster, but it will allow us more time to fix missing or incorrect images.

One of the most helpful organizational tools to keep your figures numbered correctly and track any changes is a figure list.

### Figure List

Organization is key. A well-organized figure list allows us to move your book through production more quickly and accurately. The figure list must contain the filename, location in the book, and caption for each figure. This is also where you tell us about callouts you need, whether we need to crop an image, and whether you need us to redraw something.

When creating figure lists, please use the following conventions:

1. **Fig#**: The location of the figure in the printed book.
2. **Filename**: These are the names of the files you send to us. It is very important that this information be as accurate as possible.
3. **Type/Instructions**: Drawings are handled differently than screenshots. For all screenshots, please submit electronic files. If you mark an image as a drawing, it will be redrawn by our art department according to O'Reilly's house styles. Please provide instructions for cropping, adding callouts, etc.
4. **Figure Caption**: These are very helpful for us when trying to make solve a figure placement problem or when we need to make sure we're working with the correct image in the right place in the book.
 
Here's an example of an ideal figure list.

Fig #   |   Filename   | Type/Instructions   |  Caption
 --- | --- | --- | ---
 1-1 | 01-01.pdf | Drawing. Please add an arrow pointing from the outside servers to the middle servers and label it "Workflow."   | Example of server setup showing an important idea.
 1-2 | 01-02.png | Screenshot. Pleae crop tightly on the top third. | This is what the top of thee page will look like.
 1-3 | 01-03.png | Screenshot | The image caption would go here.
 ... | ... | ... | ...
 2-1 | 02-01.png | Screenshot | Caption goes here.
 2-2 | 02-02.pdf | Drawing. Please keep the hand-drawn look and feel. | Caption goes here.
